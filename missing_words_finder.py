"""This module produces a .json file containing a dictionary of words. This
dictionary represents all the words from a text file which are not included in
the CMU pronunciation dictionary along with their syllable count. The output
from this program will aid in counting syllables for any word or phrase.

The CMU pronunciation dictionary contains data in the form:
{word : phonemes}
where phonemes are distinct units of sound - useful for counting syllables
for example {aged : ['EY1', 'JH', 'D']

For all the words not included in the CMU dictionary you can define their
syllable count manually.
